// Backfill script removed — previously used to copy plan limits into user.billing.maxWarrantyCount.
// This project now derives the allowed warranty count directly from the plan mapping in
// backend/config/billingPlans.js, so a migration is no longer necessary.

console.log('backfillMaxWarranties.js has been disabled.');
